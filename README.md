Medium - Social Healthshare
======

Medium is an open medicine platform aiming to accelerate the process of finding proper diagnosis and effective treatment of medical conditions by using the knowledge of the [crowd](https://github.com/bennidi/medium/wiki/Crowdsourcing). Machine learning techniques are applied to match people's medical stories in order to find useful pieces of information other people haven't yet discovered. One way to do that is to identify success stories of individual members which will then be selectively multiplied to others who might benefit from it - a process that already happens when people share their medical stories over a cup of coffee but that can be greatly leveraged with modern techniques of algorithmic data analysis. Furthermore, people with similar medical stories will be connected to constantly receive updates about the progress and discoveries made by their [peers](https://github.com/bennidi/medium/wiki/Medical-Profiles#medical-buddies) such that individual learnings are quickly spread through the network.

The provided medical data will also be used to compile catalogues of common medical knowledge, including lots and lots of statistics. These statistics are meant to provide guidance for the users to assess efficiencies of drugs and therapy, as well as risks like treatment side-effects or possible surgery complications.

Medium builds on the fact that every patient is an active agent in their medical story who consults doctors, undergoes clinical tests and therapy and researches various sources for relevant information. In this process, many patients become experts regarding their own condition and most of them end up with an extensive record of related medical data. Patient's knowledge and their chronologies of medical data are an invaluable source of information, not only for the owners themselves, but many others who are affected by similar symptoms. It bears the potential of saving them time, money and suffering if correct diagnosis and efficient treatment can be found more quickly. It is Medium's primary goal to find ways how to use this potential in order to increase collective health.
