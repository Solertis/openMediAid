Medium - Social Healthshare
======

Medium is an open medicine platform aiming to systematically distribute useful medical knowledge gained from its community
to individual users. It wants to selectively multiply the success stories of individual members to others who might benefit from it,
a process that already happens when people share their medical stories over a cup of coffee but that can be greatly leveraged with
modern techniques of algorithmic data analysis. Medium will also make use of statistical analysis of people's medical data and
community feedback to build catalogues of common medical knowledge accessible to everybody and with a smart search interface.

Medium understands every patient as an active agent in their medical story who consults doctors, undergoes clinical tests and therapy
and as such gathers valuable information on his or her particular condition. This chronology of medical data is an invaluable source of information,
not only for the owners themselves, but many others who are affected by similar symptoms. It bears the potential of saving them time,
money and suffering if potential diagnosis and efficient treatment can be found more quickly. It is Medium's primary goal to find ways
how to use this potential in order to increase collective health.

Note:
Medium is not a diagnostic tool that can tell you for sure what your condition is or what therapy will work for you.
It is not meant to replace consultation of experts in medicine. It is rather a source of information that can provide valuable information to
support the diagnostic process and inform about all possible options of therapy. Its suggestions are based on the experiences made by its users.
