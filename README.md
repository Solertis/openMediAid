Medium - Social Healthshare
======

Medium is an open medicine platform aiming to systematically distribute useful medical knowledge from the community to the individual. Firstly, success stories of individual members are selectively multiplied to others who might benefit from it - a process that already happens when people share their medical stories over a cup of coffee but that can be greatly leveraged with modern techniques of algorithmic data analysis. Secondly, people with similar medical stories will be linked automatically to constantly receive updates on the progress and discoveries made by their peers.

Medium will also make use of statistical analysis of provided medical data and community feedback to compile catalogues of common medical knowledge. The many statistics generated in this process are openly accessible and will provide guidance for the users to assess efficiencies of drugs or other therapy, as well as risks like treatment side-effects or possible surgery complications.

Medium builds on the fact that every patient is an active agent in their medical story who consults doctors, undergoes clinical tests and therapy and researches various sources for relevant information. In this process, many patients become experts regarding their own condition and most of them end up with an extensive record of related medical data. Patient's knowledge and their chronologies of medical data are an invaluable source of information, not only for the owners themselves, but many others who are affected by similar symptoms. It bears the potential of saving them time, money and suffering if correct diagnosis and efficient treatment can be found more quickly. It is Medium's primary goal to find ways how to use this potential in order to increase collective health.
